You have a 100 coins laying flat on a table, each with a head side and a tail side. 
10 of them are heads up, 90 are tails up. You can't feel, see or in any other way find out which side is up.
Split the coins into two piles such that there are the same number of heads in each pile.


Mathematically, for N coins in a total of M coins, just randomly pick N coins, and then flip them. Done.
