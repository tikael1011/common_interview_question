Interesting question about probability.

Q1 : You are picking N balls one by one from a K balls pile, where K means balls are numbered from 1~k, inclusively (N < K). What's the odd that the N balls are in assending order? eg: 
K = 10, N = 4, four balls are 1,2,3,4;
K = 20, N = 3, three balls are 10,19,20.

A1: 1/(N!).
